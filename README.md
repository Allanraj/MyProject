## Research Question

Analysis on Tesla Stock for the last 10 year. 

### Abstract

I am analysing the Tesla stocks and the growth of their stocks over the years. It is a simple data analysis which will help us understand the worth if a company has raised over the years. The main agenda and the interesting part for me to handle this dataset is know the rise of a happening car company. This I can use as a module to study on any company stocks and with detail analysis we can even predict the stocks growth. 


### Introduction

The dataset of Tesla stocks value are takenfrom Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/timoboz/tesla-stock-data-from-2010-to-2020#TSLA.csv) which will give an overview of rise of TESLA stock values. My study involves the stock value of how they have opened, closed, highest value, lowest value and Volume for each day from 2010-06-29 to 2020-02-03.

### Methods

I have used Matlob plotting, plotly for viewing the data for easy understanding. The reason why I chose plotting is because the data consists of date range for past 10year so plotting the values would be more practical to visualize the data. The source or the function can be found here https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html

### Results

The plotting results are as below:

The First image is a Pie chart which explains the Total volume of the stock for each year. It also gives the total number for each year.

The second image is a total understanding of the Highest price, Lowest price and closing price for the last 10 years. The image gives an understanding about the Stock rise over the years even though there was dip in the year Q2 of the year 2019.

### Discussion

I have used two methods to analyse my data, the first one is a piechart using Matplotlib. The reason I used is to find the quantitative value of stocks volume for each year.
And other plotting using plotly/scatterchart shows me a nice graph of steady Stocks growth over the year. 

The next step I would love to see is the Bar chart for each year on different field by concatenating each year data.
